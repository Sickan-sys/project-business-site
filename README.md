# Business Site
Got great help from technigos videos in starting the design. The designing part was more challenging, next time I will imitate an existing site to make the proccess hopefully quicker. 

## The problem

I don't know why, but when I upploaded my project to github the video and accordion stopped working! I really don't know why... Maybe it's something obvius, I would love to know why. I tried to use a direct url (worse quality, but that worked from codepen) but that didn't work from github.
